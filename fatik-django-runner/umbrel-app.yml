tagline: Run your Django projects on Umbrel
description: >-
  A local Django project launcher for Umbrel.  
  This app allows you to upload Django projects as ZIP archives, automatically
  unpack them, detect manage.py, settings.py, .env and requirements.txt, and
  install project dependencies inside an isolated virtual environment.
  You can start and stop any project, view its real-time logs, see the running
  process PID and uptime, switch between projects, and delete unused ones
  together with their virtual environments and logs.
  Designed to make running multiple Django applications on Umbrel easy and
  user-friendly.
