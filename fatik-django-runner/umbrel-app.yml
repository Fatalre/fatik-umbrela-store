tagline: Run your Django projects on Umbrel
description: >-
  A local Django project launcher for Umbrel.  
  This app lets you upload Django projects as ZIP archives, automatically
  unpack them, detect manage.py, settings.py, .env and requirements.txt,
  and install all dependencies inside an isolated virtual environment.
  Each project is launched on its own internal port, and the app provides
  a built-in reverse proxy so all Django projects remain accessible through
  a single Umbrel URL without exposing extra ports.

  You can run multiple projects in parallel, view real-time logs, check
  the running process PID and uptime, stop or restart individual projects,
  and delete any project together with its virtual environment and logs.

  Designed to make hosting multiple Django applications on Umbrel clean,
  secure, and user-friendly.
