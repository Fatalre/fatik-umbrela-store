description: >-
  Adminer + MariaDB in a single Umbrel application.
  When installed, it creates the main database and the root user with the password admin.
  Data is stored in app-data and persists across reboots.
  ISSUE: Sometimes it reports an incorrect password (loses the connection).
  Just enter the password 2–3 times and it will let you through.
